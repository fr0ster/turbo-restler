Simple wrapper for working with REST, Web API and Web Stream API

It's project was created half of year ago when I tried understend how work with REST, Web API and Web Stream over as libraries as [Http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http "https://pkg.go.dev/net/http") and [Gorilla](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket") on Go lang

I used library [adshao/go-binance](https://github.com/adshao/go-binance "https://github.com/adshao/go-binance") in my program so I should say thanks to guys from that project for ideas of working with REST, Web API and Web Stream API

And I should say thanks to guys from Go lang team [Http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http "https://pkg.go.dev/net/http") and [Gorilla](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket") project for their very useful libraries
